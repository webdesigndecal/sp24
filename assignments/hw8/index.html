				<h1>What we'll be doing</h1>
				<p>First, we'll be writing JS in the web console to walk through how
					<code>document.getElementById</code> can be used. Then, you'll write some code to add this toggle
					functionality for our Spotify-style playlist page:
				<p><img src="assets/images/result.gif"></p>
				</p>


				<h1>Review: How to get to the console</h1>
				<p>For this class we'll be providing instructions for using the console and tools in Google Chrome.
					Other browsers like Firefox have their own, similar console and web developer tools, but for
					consistency we recommend that you follow along using Chrome.</p>
				<p>To get to the console:
				<ol>
					<li>right-click and select Inspect Element, or cmd/ctrl + shift + i</li>
					<li>click on the Console tab</li>
					<img src="assets/images/console.png" alt="">
				</ol>
				</p>

				<h1>Part 1: Your Favorite Music</h1>
				<p>For this homework, we'll be mimicking the popular song list on a Spotify artist page. Our goal is to
					be able to toggle the second half of the songs.</p>
				<p>
					<img src="assets/images/artist.png" alt="">
				</p>
				<p>When you open <code>index.html</code> it should look like this:</p>
				<p>
					<img src="assets/images/initial.png" alt="">
				</p>
				<p>
					To be able to hide the second half of the songs, we're going to make the CSS class that we'll use in
					our JS code in the next part.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Fill in <code>index.html</code> with your top 6 favorite songs, and the artists that they're by.
					</li>
					<li>Create a class in <code>style.css</code> called <code>.hidden</code>, and give it one rule,
						<code>display: none;</code></li>
					<li><strong>Save and refresh index.html</strong> so that it has this new CSS loaded. All your song
						elements should still be visible.</li>
					<li>We'll use this CSS class in the next part.</li>
				</ol>

				<h1>Part 2: <code>document.getElementById</code></h1>
				<p>In CSS, we use the hashtag to "select" the HTML element with a certain id, and then write the CSS
					rules to apply to that element. The corresponding thing in JS is the built-in function
					<code>document.getElementById</code>, which takes one argument - a string that is the id. So in CSS,
					we would say <code>#blue-box</code>, and in JS we would say
					<code>document.getElementById("blue-box")</code>.</p>

				<p>For this part, we're going to go back to using the console. We're going to type JS code line-by-line
					into the console, so that we can really understand what is happening.</p>

				<p>We recommend that you have two browser windows open side-by-side, with this page on the left and
					<code>index.html</code> on the right, so that you can follow the instructions easily.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Open the console.</li>
					<li>Type a line to call the function to get the element with the id <code>songs-second-half</code>.
						Hit enter. The console should respond with the corresponding HTML tag! Remember how functions
						can return values? This is what the function call outputted.</li>
					<li>Move your mouse to hover over the HTML tag outputted by the console. The HTML element on the
						page (the last three songs) should be highlighted.</li>
					<li>However, we don't want to write this long line of the code every time we want to do something
						with this element. This is where variables are handy, to store something so that we can use it
						later. <br><br>Write the same line of code to get to the element, but this time store it in a
						variable called <code>songsSecondHalf</code></li>
					<li>Just for clarity, let's check what's stored in the variable. Type <code>songsSecondHalf</code>
						and hit enter. The console should again respond with the same HTML tag as earlier. Yay!</li>
					<li>JS can tell us a lot about this HTML element!! What classes does it currently have? Type
						<code>songsSecondHalf.classList</code> and see what the console responds (there should be no
						classes).</li>
					<li>What child elements does this HTML tag contain? Type <code>songsSecondHalf.innerHTML</code> and
						see what the console says.</li>
					<li>Now let's try adding a CSS class: <code>songsSecondHalf.classList.add("hidden");</code> If you
						added the <code>.hidden</code> class in <code>style.css</code> properly in part 3.1, then the
						second three songs should have disappeared!</li>
					<img src="assets/images/hidden.png" alt=""><br><br>
					<li>Try <code>songsSecondHalf.classList</code> again - the list should now include
						<code>hidden</code>.</li>
					<li>Now let's try removing the class: <code>songsSecondHalf.classList.remove("hidden");</code> The
						songs should've appeared again!</li>
					<li>Try <code>songsSecondHalf.classList</code> again - the list should be empty again.</li>
					<li>JS actually has a convenient way of doing this (adding/removing the same class), called
						<code>.classList.toggle("class")</code>. Try calling this function a few times on
						<code>songsSecondHalf</code> with the <code>hidden</code> class.</li>
					<li><strong>Take a screenshot of your console</strong> showing that you completed the steps above
						and put this screenshot in the same folder as <code>index.html</code></li>
					<li>All the stuff we do in the console is temporary, though. Let's actually code in a file now!
						<strong>Note that the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is already in the file for you.</strong>
						Create <code>script.js</code> in the assets/js folder.
					<li>Define a function named <code>toggleSongs</code>. The function should take no parameters and
						will not return a value. When the function is called, it should toggle the <code>hidden</code>
						class for the <code>#songs-second-half</code> element (which is basically what we just walked
						through in the console!).</li>
				</ol>

				<h1>Part 3: Make the toggle button work</h1>
				<p>
					Next lecture, we'll learn about how to call functions specifically when the user clicks on
					something. As a quick teaser, copy and paste this code in <code>script.js</code>, and if you wrote
					the <code>toggleSongs</code> function correctly, the button on <code>index.html</code> should now
					work! If clicking the button does not work as expected, review the previous part.
				<pre><code>document.getElementById("toggle-button").onclick = toggleSongs;</code></pre>
				</p>
